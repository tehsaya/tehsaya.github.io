<h4>Dear all,</h4>
<p>This website is dedicate to you by <a href="#">@ToanLM</a>.Initially, I was building this for purpose of practice Bootstrap and Html so I just put some shit for the content.
<p>However the development time has last longer than I though due to some technical barriers and in those delay gaps I've came up with the idea of what this site gonna do.
<p>And here you go, a sleek and intuitive design as Bootstrap promise in its homepage that I've strictly followed. But I also making some customization and elimination on my own which for this course's sake
 would help you focus better on the awesome articles I've collected along the way building this site!
 <p>Best regard!</p>
<p>Toan Le Minh</p>
